# Disfluency-Detection
Disfluency correction is the process of removing disfluent elements like fillers, repetitions and corrections from spoken utterances to create readable and interpretable text. DC is a vital post-processing step applied to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs, before subsequent processing by downstream language understanding tasks. Existing  research has primarily focused on English due to the unavailability of large-scale open-source datasets. Towards the goal of multilingual disfluency correction, we present a high-quality human-annotated corpus covering four important Indo-European languages: English, Hindi. We provide extensive analysis of results of state-of-the-art the models across all two languages obtaining F1 scores of 91.19 (English), 82.79 (Hindi).
